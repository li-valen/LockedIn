### **Permission Justifications** (Copy these exactly)

**tabs**: "Required to monitor active browser tabs and detect when users are on designated work websites. This enables accurate time tracking by identifying productive sites the user has added to their work sites list."

**storage**: "Used to store user preferences, work sites list, daily work time statistics, and extension settings locally. This ensures user data persists across browser sessions and provides offline functionality."

**activeTab**: "Needed to access the currently active tab's URL when the user opens the extension popup. This allows users to quickly add or remove the current website from their work sites list and displays real-time status information."

**identity**: "Essential for secure Google OAuth authentication. This permission enables users to sign in with their Google account to access personalized features, sync data across devices, and participate in the social leaderboard system."

**idle**: "Used to detect when the user is away from their computer or inactive. This allows the extension to intelligently pause work time tracking during idle periods, ensuring only active, productive time is recorded accurately."

**host_permissions (https://*/*)**: "Required to monitor time spent on any website that users designate as productive work sites. Users can add any website (github.com, figma.com, notion.so, etc.) to their work sites list for tracking. This permission ensures the extension can accurately track time on user-selected websites while respecting user privacy by only monitoring explicitly added sites."
