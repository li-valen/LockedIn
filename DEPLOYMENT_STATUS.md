## ⚠️ What You Need to Do (Action Required)

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Must do before submission)

#### 1. Host Privacy Policy (5 minutes)
**Why:** Chrome Web Store requires a publicly accessible privacy policy URL.

**How to do it (GitHub Pages - Free & Easy):**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Settings → Pages
3. Source: Deploy from a branch → `main` → `/ (root)`
4. Save and wait 2-3 minutes
5. Your privacy policy will be at: `https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]/PRIVACY_POLICY.html`

**Alternative:** Use Google Sites, your personal website, or any public hosting.

**Update this URL in:** Chrome Web Store listing when you submit.

#### 2. Create Screenshots (15 minutes)
**Required:** At least 1, recommended 3-5 screenshots
**Size:** 1280x800 or 640x400 pixels

**How to create:**
```
1. Open Chrome
2. Load your extension
3. Press F12 (DevTools)
4. Click "Toggle device toolbar" (phone icon)
5. Set custom size: 640 x 400
6. Take screenshots:
   - Main popup with time tracking
   - Leaderboard view  
   - Settings page with daily goal slider
   - Friend management
   - Profile stats
7. Save as PNG or JPEG
```

**What to capture:**
- ✨ Show the beautiful UI
- 📊 Display actual data (not empty states)
- 🎯 Highlight key features (time tracking, goals, leaderboards)

#### 3. Verify OAuth Configuration (10 minutes)
**Go to:** https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

**Check:**
- [ ] OAuth consent screen status is "In production" (not "Testing")
- [ ] Your extension's Client ID is listed
- [ ] Scopes include email, profile, openid
- [ ] No warnings or errors

**If status is "Testing":**
1. Go to OAuth consent screen
2. Click "PUBLISH APP"
3. Confirm publishing

### 🟡 RECOMMENDED (Improves chances of approval)

#### 4. Create Promotional Images (Optional, 30 minutes)
- Small tile: 440x280
- Marquee: 1400x560

Use Canva, Figma, or Photoshop to create branded images with:
- LockedIn logo/name
- Key feature highlights
- Purple/dark theme matching your extension

#### 5. Set Up Support Email
Create a dedicated support email:
- `support@yourdomain.com`, or
- `lockedin.support@gmail.com`, or

Add this to the Chrome Web Store listing.

## 🎯 Quick Deployment Guide

### Option A: Beta Test First (Recommended)
1. Submit as "Unlisted" visibility
2. Share link with 5-10 beta testers
3. Collect feedback
4. Fix any issues
5. Re-submit as "Public"

### Option B: Public Launch
1. Complete all action items above

## 📦 Package Your Extension

**Windows:**
```bash
prepare-webstore.bat
```

**Manual:**
```bash
npm run build
cd dist
# ZIP all contents (not the folder itself)
```

**Output:** `lockedin-webstore.zip` - ready to upload!

---

## 🚫 Known Issues to Address (Optional)

### Console Logs (65 instances)
Your code has console.log/error statements. Chrome Web Store allows this, but for production you might want to remove them.

**To remove:**
```bash
# Find all console logs
grep -r "console\." src/
```

### Bundle Size Warning
Your popup.js is 601 KiB (recommended max: 244 KiB).

**Impact:** Slower load time, but functional.

**Fix (optional):**
- Code splitting
- Lazy loading components
- Tree shaking optimization
